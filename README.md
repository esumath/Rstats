# Rstats

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:

The web app is deployed on <https://esumath.shinyapps.io/rstats/>

## About

The goal of Rstats is to to promote studentsâ€™ interest in [**R
programming**](https://cran.r-project.org/) while learning
**introductory statistics**. Installation and configuration are not
needed as a web-based application. Students interested in coding can
copy the **R code** in the app and paste to the R workspace installed on
their PC or Mac to **reproduce** the data analysis results. However, the
functionality is point-and-click so those uninterested in coding will
not be intimidated by the features. The app was intended for students in
all PASSHE ([**PA State System of Higher
Education**](https://www.passhe.edu)) schools to use. It is expected to
be adopted by more undergraduate universities. Please contact me
**<xzhang2@esu.edu>** if you have any suggestions or ideas to improve
this web app.


## Usage

Download this repository and then open the app.R file using
